Made temporarily deployable with: 
Vercel, SupaBase, Render

## Inspiration
The inspiration for our project mainly stemmed from problems of being unable to see UCSC life activity that is happening all around them. Many peers face social problems, such as struggling to spread the word that they need to get rid of their furniture, or club events. Our webpage fosters a community between UCSC students and encourages curiosity by showing all events near you.

## What it does
Our app basically has a centralized map of only the UCSC campus, and allows user to create an account using their emails. From there, students can create a pin on someplace on the place, and then add context to their event. This can range from a variety of events, such as cutting hair, giving furniture away, selling baked goods, or even selling used textbooks. It is also a place where anyone can create an event open to the public, working as a center stage for small voices in the community.

## How we built it
First we started with an idea of what we needed to build, a centralized app for all students that would allow us to easily view/create an event of our choice. We built it using a NERP tech stack, which includes React Front end, Express.js for backend calls, Node.js, and PostgresSQL to handle databasing

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into we're mainly environment based, as two members of our group windows and one had a mac, but we ultimately were able to push through.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what our website looks like with the time constraints that we were given, and we came out with a MVP.

## What we learned
We learned a lot, but I think we mainly learned how to work together as a team and communicate our needs in a high pressure situation.

## What's next for Cruzly
I believe the next big thing for our project would to expand upon our user customization, such as a profile or review system. As well as implementing filters to customize what events users see first.
